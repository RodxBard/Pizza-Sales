# Pizza-Sales
A Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project
In this Project I built a Tableau's Dashboard from a public Pizza Sales Dataset.

The following steps were taken:

1- Dataset import to Database (SQL Server).

2 - Data extraction and management. Using SQL Server Management Studio I made queries in the sales table to extract specific data such as KPIs, pizza sales, pizza orders, total revenue.

3- Tableau: In Tableau's worksheet we built charts of: Hourly trend sales; Weekly trend sales; Sales by Category; Sales by Size; Total Orders; Total Sold. 

4- The dashboard was built after these charts were made. It allows us visualize all the information in the same page and also check sales performance, in specific period or pizza category.

5- We can give insights to the Business Manager after the dashboard is built. The most import are shown in the left part of the screen.
